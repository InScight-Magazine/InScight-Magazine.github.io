Our readership ranges from experts in the scientific community to common people. We must ensure that our content, may it be themed on whichever subject, is understandable and digestible to all - even someone with just high school science background. So be prepared to write at that level.

- We accept written content in English, Bangla and Hindi. We will consider including pieces in other vernacular languages, subject to availability of editors.
Please make sure that your written content is devoid of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. Please run it through spell-check and grammar-check softwares before submitting.
- Plagiarism in any form and from any source will not be tolerated.
- Everything that you write about should be fact-checked. You must provide references. We will make sure that the references do not interfere with the flow of your article and will make them separately available for interested readers.
- You may send us an image/infographic/graphical abstract to go with your written content. Please make sure that you credit the source.
- Written content should be submitted as a word document. For web version, there is no limit but articles for print need to be less than 1000 words. Any images/infographics should be submitted as high resolution files (150 dpi or higher).
- If you submit articles which have been published elsewhere or in your personal blog, you should declare the terms involved with the publication, during submission itself. However, it is encouraged to submit original content.
- While covering a research news story or a scientific topic review, it is mandatory that you include comments/quotes from either an author of the research or from an expert in that field of study.
- Editing and publishing of content will be at the discretion of the editorial board of the magazine.

**Specific guidelines for Interviews**

- The person conducting the interview must submit the audio file/email conversation with the concerned person.
- In case of an audio file, the transcript of the interview in its entirety must be submitted.
- One of our editors will then fine tune it for clarity and consult the interviewer if required.
- The editorial board will then send the final document to the interviewee for their approval and publish the final document after it has been vetted.

**Specific guidelines for Video Content**

- We accept video content in English, Hindi, Bangla, Odia, Marathi, Tamil, Kannada and Assamese.
- You are required to send us a script for your video in advance. Please make sure you include references for your statements and follow all other general guidelines.
- One of our video moderators will get in touch with you and give you a green signal, following which you can begin working on your video.
- Keep your video short (<5 mins) and structure your script accordingly.
- You are required to submit the raw audio and video files. Our team will make necessary edits to it.

_P.S. — We want to extend the linguistic reach of our videos and are constantly looking for moderators. If you're a student/alumni of IISER Kolkata, and are interested in moderating videos in any language other than the ones mentioned above, feel free to get in touch._

**#WIISER guidelines**

- If you select a faculty and want to conduct an interview, mail us stating your interest.
- A member from the editorial board will get in touch with you for a discussion.
- After this much required discussion, you can go ahead with the interview.
- We prefer the interview be conducted over email and kept short (max 5 questions).
- We will also accept transcripts of recordings, in which case the questions should be sent to the concerned faculty in advance.

Submit your content here if you're interested to contribute.

**Potential ideas for content**

- Interviews — Interviews of scientists/researchers about how they led their team to an important discovery/invention, their philosophical view of life, their messages to the scientific community, which will inspire budding scientists.
- Biographies — Biographical essays of people in science.
- Opinion pieces — Your personal opinion about a scientific subject or a ‘science and society’ scenario. (Must be written in first person)
- News — News stories about recent scientific proceedings from your lab or any other lab in India or abroad (based on a research paper published in a peer-reviewed journal), News about a ‘science and society’ issue, News about a recent scientific progress (or it's anti-thesis).
- Reviews — Book reviews, scientific topic reviews, Sci-Fi movie reviews.
- Perspectives — funding issues in science, how science affects your personal life, field challenges faced by field scientists, work ethics in the scientific community etc.
- Snippets — small write-ups refuting blind faiths and unscientific myths that we encounter in our daily lives
- Sci-toons — Comics, memes, infographics etc. (Surprise us!)
- Artwork — Simulation generated patterns, fractals, over-simplified graphs explaining a concept etc.
