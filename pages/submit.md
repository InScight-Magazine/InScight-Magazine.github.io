We are always happy to accept publishable content from students as well as practitioners of science. The final decision on whether to publish any particular submission lies with our editorial team. All content that we decide to publish will be edited by our team for clarity, correctness and readability. All submitted content must be primarily the intellectual property of the author. Use of content from elsewhere must be properly cited, and any plagiarism will result in immediate rejection of the submission. 

We currently accept submissions in these categories:
<br>
- Science articles (1500-2500 words)
- Summary of published research (300-400 words)
- Interviews of people in science academia
- Crosswords, Quizzes, Linked list (all focussing on science)
<br>
<br>

Please read the respective submission guidelines for the category of your submission very carefully before submitting content to us. 

### Science articles
As the main content of our magazines, please submit scientific articles describing interesting ideas in science, through [this form]({{ site.data.socials["articleForm"] }}). The articles should be roughly between 1500 and 2500 words in length, and should preferably be readable by a broad non-technical audience. The writing must be original, and should be supported by images/figures wherever necessary. All images must have appropriate captions, and all information used from other sources must be properly cited. 

### Summaries of published research
This section of our magazine showcases summaries of recently published research articles; the summary should specify the question being probed in the article, the motivation for probing this question, and the major results of the work, all within 300-400 words. Send us your contributions through [this form]({{ site.data.socials["researchSummaryForm"] }}). The goal is to present to our readers the landscape of science at the very frontiers of research. This is in contrast to the long-form science articles previously mentioned, that primarily discuss time-tested and well-understood ideas in science. Accordingly, this section is intended for a more specialised audience.

### Interviews
Typically, we (InScight) conduct our own interviews, but we are also happy to publish any interview that you might have taken of some notable person (working in science academia). Send us the audio/text file of the interview at [scicomm@iiserkol.ac.in](mailto:scicomm@iiserkol.ac.in).

### Science games
Our magazine features games like crosswords, quizzes and [linked lists](/games/), all based on scientific themes. If you have ideas for such games or if you have come up with crosswords, quiz questions or linked lists that you want us to publish (with proper attribution of course), send us the stuff at [scicomm@iiserkol.ac.in](mailto:scicomm@iiserkol.ac.in).
