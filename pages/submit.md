Written content should be created as a **word/latex/markdown file**. Any images/infographics should be submitted in as high a resolution as possible. You may send us an image/infographic/graphical abstract to go with your written content. Compress all files into an archive, and submit it through [this form](site.data.socials["submit-form"]).

## Submission Guidelines
- We accept written content in English, Bangla and Hindi. 
- We must ensure that our content, may it be themed on whichever subject, is understandable and digestible to all - even someone with just high school science background. 
- If you submit articles which have been published elsewhere or in your personal blog, you should declare the terms involved with the publication, during submission itself.
- Please make sure that your written content is devoid of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors.
- Plagiarism in any form and from any source will not be tolerated.
- Everything that you write about should be fact-checked and backed by references.
- While covering a research news story or a scientific topic review, it is mandatory that you include comments/quotes from either an author of the research or from an expert in that field of study.
- The sources of all images should be cited.
