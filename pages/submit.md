Please read the submission guidelines provided below very carefully before submitting content to us. The content can be based on any aspect of science that you find interesting and **non-trivial**, and that you feel can be appreciated by a general audience. All files must be compressed into a single archive and submitted through [this form]({{ site.data.socials["submitForm"] }}).

## Guidelines for submission

Written content should be created as a **plain text** file or a **markdown** file, in English, Bengali or Hindi. The length should be roughly between 700 and 1500 words. It would be helpful if you can also provided a small abstract (pitch) of the article as well as a header image for the top of the article.

Images should be provided separately, even if they are embedded within the document. The sources and captions for the images can be mentioned either within the document or in a separate text file. The sources of all images should be cited. Try to provide the images in as high a resolution as possible.

You must ensure that the content is understandable by someone with a high school science background. Try to use as few technical terms as possible. If the content is already published elsewhere, please specify the terms of publication. Plagiarized content is not allowed in any form. Please try to fact-check your content as much as possible, and provide references to back up your statements.
