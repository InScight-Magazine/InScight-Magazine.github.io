The sources and captions for the images can be mentioned either within the document or in a separate text file. It would be helpful if you can also provided a small abstract (pitch) of the article as well as a header image for the top of the article. Compress all files into an archive, and submit it through [this form]({{ site.data.socials["submitForm"] }}).
