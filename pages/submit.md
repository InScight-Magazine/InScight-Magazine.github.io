We are always happy to accept publishable content from students as well as practitioners of science. The final decision on whether to publish any particular submission lies with our editorial team. All content that we decide to publish will be edited by our team for clarity, correctness and readability. All submitted content must be primarily the intellectual property of the author. Use of content from elsewhere must be properly cited, and any plagiarism will result in immediate rejection of the submission. 

We currently accept submissions in these categories:
<br>
- Science articles (> 1500 words)
- Summary of published research (< 500 words)
- PhD stories (> 3000 words)

If you have some other category in mind that you want to contribute, we will be delighted to discuss it with you [over email]({{ site.data.socials["email"] }}).
<p></p>

Please read the respective submission guidelines for the category of your submission very carefully before submitting content to us. All content can be submitted in text-based (latex/markdown/typst etc) or WYSIWYG (google docs/.docx./.odt etc) formats. For any queries, contact us [through email]({{ site.data.socials["email"] }})

### Science articles
As the main content of our magazines, please submit scientific articles describing interesting ideas in science, through [this form]({{ site.data.socials["articleForm"] }}). 
- The writing must be **original**.
- The article should be roughly between **1500 and 2500 words** in length.
- It must be readable by a broad **non-technical audience**, primarily undergraduate students from various disciplines. This means, for example, that any technical term you use must be explained within the article itself.
- Add **references** whenever you can, to support your claims. Don't worry about specific styles of adding references, we will take care of that.
- Add **images** generously. We recommend adding an image for every 600 words. All images must have detailed captions and the source of the image should be clearly mentioned in the caption. Each image must be cited in the main text as well.
<p></p>
For a **canonical example** of what we are looking for, check out [this article](/issue2/nobel/) by Prof. Neelanjana Sengupta of IISER Kolkata on the 2024 Nobel prizes.

### Insight Digest: Summaries of published research
We have an 'Insight Digest' section in our magazine where we showcase summaries of recently published research articles; the goal is to present to our readers the landscape of science at the very frontiers of research. This is in contrast to the long-form science articles previously mentioned, that primarily discuss time-tested and well-understood ideas in science. Accordingly, this section is intended for a more specialised audience. Send us your contributions through [this form]({{ site.data.socials["researchSummaryForm"] }}). 

- The summary should specify the question being probed in the article, the motivation for probing this question, and the major results of the work
- A rough size for the writeup is between within **300 and 500 words**.
- We also request you to attach a **single image** with your submission, that conveys the essence of the work as best as possible. The image should have a detailed caption that explains what the image is showing and how it relates to your writeup.

For a **canonical example** of what we are looking for, check out the [Insight Digest](/issue3/digest/) section of our latest issue.

### PhD Stories
This is a new section in our magazine, where we intend to publish one article every issue focusing on the research arc of a Ph.D. student. The point of the article is to describe a coherent line of argument that connects various research works carried out during the PhD tenure. Use [this form]({{ site.data.socials["articleForm"] }}) to submit your articles.

- It can be contributed by any Ph.D. student in their **fourth year and onwards**, as well as by **post-doctoral researchers** who wish to discuss about their doctoral research.
- The article can be slightly longer than the general science articles. We recommend that it be wrapped up within **5000 words**.
- The article should state clearly the **broad questions** being tackled by the PhD student, why these questions are **important**, and how the research carried out by the student **helped answer** these questions.
- The article should be understood by a **general audience** (undergraduate students in various disciplines). Technical words should be used sparingly, and whenever used must be explained clearly.
- Use **figures** generously. The guidelines about images mentioned in the "Science Articles" section hold here as well.
