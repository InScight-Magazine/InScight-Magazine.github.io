We are always happy to accept publishable content from students as well as practitioners of science. The final decision on whether to publish any particular submission lies with our editorial team. All content that we decide to publish will be edited by our team for clarity, correctness and readability. All submitted content must be primarily the intellectual property of the author. Use of content from elsewhere must be properly cited, and any plagiarism will result in immediate rejection of the submission. 

We currently accept submissions in these categories:
<br>
- Science articles (1500-2500 words)
- Summary of published research (300-400 words)
- Interviews of people in science academia
- Crosswords, Quizzes, Linked list (all focussing on science)
<br>
<br>

Please read the respective submission guidelines for the category of your submission very carefully before submitting content to us. 

<h3>Science articles</h3>
Written content should be created as a **plain text** file or a **markdown** file, in English, Bengali or Hindi. The length should be roughly between 700 and 1500 words. It would be helpful if you can also provided a small abstract (pitch) of the article as well as a header image for the top of the article.

Images should be provided separately, even if they are embedded within the document. The sources and captions for the images can be mentioned either within the document or in a separate text file. The sources of all images should be cited. Try to provide the images in as high a resolution as possible.

You must ensure that the content is understandable by someone with a high school science background. Try to use as few technical terms as possible. If the content is already published elsewhere, please specify the terms of publication. Plagiarized content is not allowed in any form. Please try to fact-check your content as much as possible, and provide references to back up your statements.
