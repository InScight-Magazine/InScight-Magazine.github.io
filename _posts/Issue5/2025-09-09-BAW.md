## Genesis Of The Conference

The Bioanalytical Workshop (BAW), organized by the Department of Biological Sciences at IISER Kolkata, has emerged as a unique platform that seamlessly blends hands-on training with interactive learning. Designed for students and early-career researchers, BAW focuses on advanced analytical techniques while emphasizing translational research, equipping participants with the skills needed to make meaningful contributions to cutting-edge biomedical science.

Since its first edition in 2018 in Gangtok, BAW has grown rapidly in scale and reputation. Subsequent editions, held at IISER Kolkata, Ooty, Kalimpong, and supported by agencies such as SERB and DHR-ICMR, have received overwhelming responses. Each edition has built on the success of its predecessors, with BAW 2025 continuing this legacy under the theme "*Frontiers in Disease Biology*". This edition combined an international scientific conference with immersive, skill-based workshops, reflecting the initiative's commitment to keeping pace with evolving research technologies and preparing the next generation of scientists for the challenges of modern biomedicine

## BAW 2025: A Confluence of Science and Skills

BAW 2025 brought together a vibrant community of scientists, researchers, and students to explore the latest breakthroughs in disease biology. The conference featured internationally renowned experts such as *Ofer Reizes* from the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute (USA), *Yasuyuki Fujita* from Kyoto University (Japan), and *Yusuke Toyama* from the Mechanobiology Institute at the National University of Singapore. Their talks offered invaluable insights into areas ranging from mechanobiology to cancer biology, setting the tone for a truly global exchange of ideas.

Equally inspiring were contributions from some of India's leading scientists, including *Partha Pratim Majumder*, National Science Chair and Founding Director of NIBMG; *Chandrima Shaha* from CSIR-IICB; and *Arup Banerjee* from the Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Haryana. Their lectures covered cutting-edge topics such as disease genetics, cellular dynamics, and innovative therapeutic strategies, ensuring participants were exposed to the forefront of biomedical research.

Complementing these discussions were immersive training sessions in essential techniques like animal handling, histopathology, flow cytometry, and advanced microscopy. For many attendees, this was their first real experience working with sophisticated research methods, making the workshop as practical as it was intellectually enriching. This combination of expert-led discourse and hands-on training gave participants not just knowledge, but the confidence to translate their learning into impactful research.

## Diverse Themes, Shared Vision

The strength of BAW 2025 lay in its interdisciplinary approach. Themes spanned infection biology, stress physiology, molecular triggers of disease, neurodegeneration, mechanobiology, and tumor microenvironments. The integration of these diverse areas fostered a holistic understanding of disease biology and encouraged participants to think beyond traditional silos, sparking ideas for inovative collaborations.

## Impact Beyond the Event
The impact of BAW 2025 goes far beyond the five days of sessions. The knowledge, skills, and networks built during the conference will empower participants to launch impactful research initiatives and forge partnerships that address health challenges at local, national, and global scales. By inspiring and equipping a new generation of scientists, BAW strengthens not only India's biomedical research ecosystem but also its contribution to worldwide efforts to improve human health.

## Hands-on workshop on pre-clinical mouse models

The BAW conference provided students with an invaluable and immersive opportunity to engage directly with fundamental experimental techniques at the heart of modern biomedical research. Through focused, hands-on sessions, participants developed essential skills in key areas. *Animal Handling* gave them a deeper understanding of how preclinical models are used to explore disease mechanisms and test therapeutic interventions. The *Histopathology* module introduced them to the microscopic study of tissues, sharpening their ability to recognize disease-associated changes at the cellular level. In *Flow Cytometry* sessions, they gained practical experience with high-throughput cell analysis techniques that are crucial for immunological profiling and disease characterization. *Microscopy* training acquainted them with advanced imaging tools that reveal intricate cellular and molecular structures in exceptional detail.For many students, this was their first real experience of working hands-on in a biomedical research setting. It not only strengthened their technical abilities but also sparked genuine curiosity and broadened their understanding of biology, inspiring many to consider future careers in life sciences, research, and translational medicine.

## The Spirit of BAW: Student Initiative, Scientific Excellence, and Cultural Expression

What truly sets BAW 2025 apart is its collaborative and student-driven foundation. Unlike conventional scientific conferences, BAW thrives on the passion, dedication, and teamwork of its student organizers. The event reflects the commitment of faculty mentors and the tireless efforts of an exceptionally enthusiastic group of student volunteers who take responsibility for everything. They manage accommodation and travel arrangements, host and anchor events, oversee food and hospitality, capture the moments through photography, and even lead live laboratory demonstrations. Their involvement goes far beyond logistics. It gives them a rare opportunity to develop leadership, organizational, and communication skills that will serve them throughout their careers.

The conference also provides a stage to showcase IISER Kolkata's state-of-the-art research facilities to national and international participants, strengthening the institute's presence in the global scientific community. Adding warmth and vibrancy, BAW ends each year with a cultural evening. This is a celebration of art and camaraderie where faculty, students, and participants come together to share their talents in music, dance, drama, and poetry. This unique blend of science and culture creates an atmosphere that is as inspiring as it is welcoming.As BAW continues to grow in scale and reputation, it is set to evolve into a recognized scientific society that will nurture the next generation of bioscience professionals.

## Conclusion

Since its inception in 2012, the Bioanalytical Workshop has grown remarkably, attracting an increasing number of applicants each year. About 250 students took part in the 2025 edition, which reflects both the program's credibility and the transformative experience it offers. One of BAW's defining features is its student-led model, where young scholars are not just attendees but active contributors. They take charge of organizing and leading the hands-on demonstrations that form the core of the event.

Over time, the workshop has expanded well beyond its early focus on neurobiology to embrace multiple areas of disease biology. This year's theme, "Frontiers in Disease Biology," reflects that broader vision. Beyond technical training, BAW has become a vibrant platform for networking, professional growth, and peer-to-peer learning. It creates opportunities for meaningful connections that often lead to collaborations shaping the future of biomedical research.

The workshop also ensures that participants feel at home. Each year, they are treated to delicious meals, and 2025 was no exception. The variety, flavor, and quality of the food earned praise from both students and distinguished speakers, adding a thoughtful and memorable touch to the scientific program.

The cultural evening provided the perfect conclusion. It was a time to relax, celebrate, and showcase creativity through art and performance. Altogether, BAW 2025 was far more than just a workshop. It was a transformative experience that shaped skilled researchers, encouraged leadership, and fostered a dynamic and close-knit scientific community.
