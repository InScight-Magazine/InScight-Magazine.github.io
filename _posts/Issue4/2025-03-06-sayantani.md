excerpt: "*What if plants could talk? Not with words-but with scents.* In a hidden world of airborne messages and underground signals, plants release special chemicals called VOCs to call for help, warn their neighbors, confuse attackers, and even sabotage rivals. Dive into this fascinating world with Sayantani Nath where leaves cry for help, roots make alliances, and researchers uncover natures invisible language-one scent at a time."
