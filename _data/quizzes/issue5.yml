questions:
  - "The figure below shows an immunohistochemistry (IHC) image of a solid tumor section. The brown-stained cells represent an immune cell population that accumulates in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and is known for suppressing cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity, thereby promoting tumor immune evasion. *Which immune cell type is most consistent with this immunosuppressive role in the TME?*"
  - "Chronic psychosocial stress has been repeatedly associated with increased risk for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. A recent Frontiers in Physiology (2024) review emphasized the central role of neuroendocrine dysregulation in linking stress to long-term disease outcomes. In particular, one hormonal axis has been shown to mediate the release of glucocorticoids such as cortisol, which in turn dysregulate glucose metabolism, immune function, and cardiovascular physiology. *Which of the following pathways is most directly involved in this mechanism?*"
  - "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are being rapidly integrated into healthcare to improve early disease prediction. A Frontiers in Medicine (2023) review showed that AI algorithms applied to radiological imaging have dramatically increased diagnostic accuracy in certain infectious diseases. *Among the following, which disease has seen the greatest progress in AI-based diagnostic imaging due to global prevalence and high chest X-ray availability?*"
  - "Parkinson’s disease is characterized by progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Beyond dopamine loss, recent studies in Nature Medicine (2024) highlight the contribution of neuroinflammation to disease progression. Clinical trials are now investigating therapies that specifically target inflammatory signaling pathways. *Which pathway is currently one of the most promising therapeutic targets for slowing Parkinson’s progression?*"
  - "Recent research on SARS-CoV-2 (Cell, 2023) has highlighted that the viral spike protein is not only responsible for enabling viral entry into host cells through ACE2 binding but also plays an active role in disease severity. Studies have demonstrated that the spike protein can act as a signaling molecule that interacts with host immune sensors. *Which of the following findings best explains this additional role of the spike protein in infection biology?*"
  - "Pathogenic bacteria often interfere with host cell processes to create a favorable niche for survival and replication. A Nature Microbiology (2024) study recently revealed that certain bacterial effectors delivered via secretion systems directly modify host chromatin, influencing transcriptional activity. This strategy allows the pathogen to silence host defense genes and promote infection. *Which of the following mechanisms best describes this form of epigenetic manipulation?*"
  - "Advances in cancer diagnostics are shifting toward minimally invasive approaches that can detect tumors at earlier stages. According to Lancet Oncology (2024), liquid biopsy has emerged as one of the most powerful clinical tools in oncology, as it allows detection of tumor-derived genetic material in circulation. *Which of the following is the primary biomarker analyzed in liquid biopsy for cancer detection and monitoring?*"
  - "Cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease has long been attributed to amyloid plaque deposition, but recent Nature Neuroscience (2023) findings challenge this view by showing that synaptic dysfunction occurs much earlier than visible plaque accumulation. Researchers now argue that pathological mislocalization of a specific neuronal protein destabilizes microtubules and disrupts synaptic signaling before large aggregates form. *Which protein is primarily implicated in this early synaptic dysfunction?*"
  - "Refer to the diagram below showing the HIF-1 signaling pathway under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. *Which process occurs as a direct consequence of HIF-1α stabilization under hypoxic tumor conditions?*"
  - "Refer to the schematic diagram above illustrating the structure and activation of the Piezo1 mechanosensitive ion channel. Under mechanical stimuli such as changes in substrate stiffness or shear stress, *which of the following correctly describes the role of the Piezo1 channel in stem cell fate regulation?*"
