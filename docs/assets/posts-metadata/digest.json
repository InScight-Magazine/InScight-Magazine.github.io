      "summary": "Dual comb spectroscopy (DCS) is a powerful optical sensing technique that leverages two laser frequency combs, to measure gas absorption with high speed and sensitivity. By precisely determining the absorption frequencies of the sample, across a broad spectral range, DCS can detect trace gases like carbon dioxide (CO#sub[2]) and water vapor (H#sub[2]O) in the atmosphere with sub-ppm precision. This makes it ideal for applications in climate science, especially relevant for air quality monitoring, greenhouse gas emissions tracking, etc.Traditionally, the reach of DCS when performed in open path has been limited to distances under 20 km due to significant signal loss and technical constraints, such as the need for highly reflective mirrors, high atmospheric turbulence, etc. However, last year, in a landmark advancement, researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China have now extended DCS to a staggering 113 km open-air horizontal path; nearly six times longer than previous records.To achieve this, the team utilized a novel bistatic configuration, placing one frequency comb at each end of the path and transmitting light bidirectionally through the atmosphere without the need for reflectors. Each comb was synchronized to a rubidium atomic clock, acting as a local timing reference. The system incorporated high-power (1 W) optical frequency combs, stable telescopes, and real-time data acquisition to overcome atmospheric turbulence and extreme signal attenuation, going up to 83 dB.The experiment, conducted between two mountain sites in the Xinjiang, provice of China, viz. Nanshan and Gaoyazi, successfully measured absorption spectra of CO#sub[2] and H#sub[2]O over a 7 nm bandwidth and a frequency accuracy of 10 kHz. The system achieved CO#sub[2] detection sensitivities better than 2 ppm in just 5 minutes and below 0.6 ppm in 36 minutes; a remarkable performance for such a long-range setup.This breakthrough not only validates DCS for ultra-long-range sensing but also opens a plethora of possibilities for a diverse set of technological advancements. A curious reader would ask, if one can perform DCS over 100 km path in the turbulent atmosphere, why not shoot it towards the sky? Can the dual comb reach the ionosphere (50 km) and get reflected with only the radio wave content? Can it lay the foundation for future satellite-ground dual comb links? Can it perform high-precision monitoring of greenhouse gases from geostationary orbits? I leave the numerous possibilities to the fancy of your imagination!",

      "summary": "The oldest telescopic observation of the sun is only four centuries old. Thanks to nature's silent archivists, it is possible to unveil how this star behaved multiple millennia ago. Tree rings are one such natural reservoir that keeps a record of the time. Cosmogenic isotope contents in old tree rings carry imprints of the terrestrial climate, which in turn is modulated by the sun's magnetic activity. A more magnetically active sun sweeps away galactic cosmic rays more vigorously. As a consequence, the production rate of radioactive isotopes in the earth’s atmosphere goes down. This results in a reduced amount of Carbon-14 deposition in the tree rings during the period of enhanced solar activity, and vice-versa. Recently, scientists have used precise dendrochronological techniques to retrieve the sun's magnetic behaviour during the first millennium BCE with an unprecedented resolution of annual time scale. They have successfully detected a strong decennial timescale signal in the isotope data, as expected from current understanding of the solar cycles. Besides, their analysis hints towards possible occurrences of two solar grand minimum episodes during this period. Solar grand minima are phases of prolonged magnetic quiescence on the sun. These findings have implications for a better understanding of solar-stellar magnetism.",

      "author": "Madhura Narayan Joshi",
      "affiliation": "22MS, IISER Kolkata",
      "summary": "One of the key indicators of climate change is global warming — often discussed in academic circles and increasingly felt in daily life. A major driver of this warming is the rising concentration of atmospheric CO#sub[2] over recent decades. Oceans, which store about 90% of Earth’s carbon (combined oceanic, atmospheric, and terrestrial), play a vital role in regulating the carbon cycle and influencing climate.During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), around 25,000 to 20,000 years ago, Earth’s surface was 3–6 °C colder, atmospheric CO#sub[2] levels were 80–90 ppm lower, and vast ice sheets and sea ice covered the poles. Unlike the modern ocean, where Arctic-origin waters dominate and Antarctic waters occupy depths below 4 km, LGM oceans were filled with Antarctic-sourced waters up to 2 km, compressing northern water masses into shallower layers. This reorganization of deep water circulation reduced CO#sub[2] escape from the ocean surface and drew down atmospheric concentrations by 10–20 ppm.Previously, these shifts were seen as a sum of individual physical changes — altered currents, increased layering, and less CO#sub[2] outgassing from the Southern Ocean. Several mechanisms contributed: an equatorward shift of the Southern Hemisphere westerlies weakened upwelling of deeper water, increased stratification acted like a lid on carbon venting, expanded sea ice reduced air-sea exchange, and reduced mixing between northern and southern waters limited carbon leakage.Overturning circulation is a large-scale movement of ocean water where warmer, lighter surface waters move toward the poles, cool, and sink to form deep currents that eventually return to the surface. This circulation is driven by two main factors: flow along isopycnals (surfaces of equal density) and surface buoyancy flux — which reflects whether water in a region is becoming lighter (due to warming or precipitation) or denser (due to cooling, brine rejection, or evaporation). These isopycnals slope steeply at high latitudes, and a key one  the 27.9 kg/m³ isopycnal which separates the shallow and deep overturning branches in the Southern Ocean.In today’s climate, the sea ice edge stays close to Antarctica, and the isopycnal plunges below 2 km before reaching ocean basins. There, it intersects topography like ridges and seamounts, enhancing mixing and connecting the two branches into a single, figure-eight-like circulation. However, during the LGM, the summer sea ice line shifted northward by about 500 km. The isopycnal followed, shoaling above 2 km and avoiding major topography. Without significant mixing, the circulation split into two separate loops: deep Antarctic waters recirculated beneath the ice, while northern-sourced waters looped above. This vertical separation helped trap carbon in the deep ocean.",

      "summary": "We usually think of rivers as part of the modern carbon cycle — transporting carbon that plants have recently absorbed from the atmosphere. But this new study reveals that rivers also act as a hidden highway, carrying very old carbon — hundreds to thousands of years old — from land into the air.Scientists examined over 1,100 samples from rivers all over the world, looking at the type of carbon gases (CO#sub[2] and CH#sub[4]) being released into the air. By measuring radiocarbon (a kind of natural carbon dating), they could determine how “old” the carbon was. Surprisingly, nearly 60% of river CO#sub[2] emissions were found to come from millennia-old carbon, not recent plant activity.This “old” carbon comes from deep in the soil, sediments, and even from ancient rocks. Rain and groundwater erode and carry this carbon into rivers, which then release it into the atmosphere. The amount of old carbon released — around 1.2 billion tons per year — is nearly as much as all the carbon plants worldwide absorb from the atmosphere in a year.Different factors affect how much old carbon a river releases. Rivers in areas with sedimentary rocks, like limestone, or those in high mountain regions, were more likely to release older carbon. Large rivers also showed older carbon emissions, which challenges the common belief that only small rivers are affected by old carbon sources.These findings mean that current climate models and carbon budgets may be underestimating how much ancient carbon is being released. Old carbon, once locked in the earth, is now entering the modern carbon cycle — potentially speeding up climate change.This study suggests we need to rethink how rivers fit into the global carbon puzzle. Rivers are not just channels for young, fresh carbon. They are also leaks for ancient carbon stores, and this has major implications for how we understand and manage Earth’s carbon balance.",

      "author": "Dhiman Sankar Pal",
      "affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology and Center for Cell Dynamics, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA",
      "summary": "In mammalian cells, directed migration is crucial for a multitude of physiological processes ranging from embryogenesis, cancer metastasis, to immune response. Although Ras and its downstream pathways are typically associated with longer-term growth control, our studies showed how the Ras-mTORC2-Akt growth-control axis steers leukocyte migration on a rapid timescale, independently of new gene or protein expression.To this end, we designed blue-light controlled, cryptochrome-based dimerizers to abruptly and locally perturb Ras or Akt activity in human neutrophils and macrophages, bypassing the chemoattractant-sensing receptor/G-protein network. Within seconds of global recruitment of CAAX-deleted version of constitutively active Ras isoforms or a RasGEF, RasGRP4, initially quiescent cells spread and migrated rapidly. Thus, Ras proteins directly promote random motility. Furthermore, by activating Ras at the cell rear, new F-actin rich protrusions emerged locally, thereby reversing pre-existing polarity and steering sustained migration towards the light source. Interestingly, locally recruiting the crucial Ras-mTORC2 effector, Akt1 or Akt2, had similar effects.Next, employing a RasGAP, RASAL3, we were interested to test the effects of reducing Ras in migrating cells. Globally or locally dampening Ras activity at cell fronts could extinguish protrusions and abolish polarity or migration, as expected. However, surprisingly, an acute reduction in Ras activity specifically at the cell back increased both polarity and random motility. Further experimentation showed that cell polarity can be achieved by suppressing Ras activity at the cell rear resulting in locally increased actomyosin contractility. These unexpected outcomes of attenuating Ras activity naturally had strong, context-dependent consequences for chemotaxis.Our experimental results upended existing models of cell polarity, and a new computational model in which Ras levels control separate front and back feedback loops was proposed. Taken together, our unanticipated findings on cell polarity and migration have crucial implications for cancer treatment. While a target of intense interest for cancer therapy, Ras inhibition may not always be beneficial i.e., attempts to abrogate cell proliferation could force cells into a more polarized migratory state, thereby promoting metastasis. Minimally, our study suggests that a deeper understanding of the different roles of Ras activity is needed for developing therapeutic strategies.",

      "summary": "The widespread applications of petroleum-derived polyolefins can be attributed to their favorable physicochemical properties and economic viability. However, the environmental footprint of polyolefins is increasingly concerning, as their mass-production, single-use-nature, and slow decomposition contribute to long-term ecological pollution. Chemical recycling of polyolefins, conventionally involves processes-pyrolysis or steam cracking resulting in significantly lower yields of constituting monomers even under high temperatures(~800 °C) or harsh conditions.Effective resolution of this issue is contingent upon the development of polyethylene-like polymers that are both chemically recyclable and capable of replicating the key attributes of traditional polyolefins. Inclusion of ester or amide functionalities can operate as predetermined breaking sites within the polymer chain, enabling depolymerization at milder condition and yielding monomers suitable for re-polymerization.In the aforementioned paper, Miyake and co-workers had reported the synthesis of bio-based polyethylene-like polymer-materials from linear and branched diols via Acceptor-less Dehydrogenative Polymerization(ADP), which display efficient depolymerization too, catalyzed with earth-abundant Manganese complex and exhibit highly tunable material properties. The crystallizable saturated linear monomer and unsaturated monomer were derived from fatty acids (plant-based oils), contributing high melting temperature(Tm) and modulus with its long linear methylene chains. The thiol-ene reactions with thiols, yielding high efficiency, enables the synthesis of branched monomers influencing polymer morphologies and thermomechanical properties. The authors had highlighted the manganese-based complex [Mn] as the most efficient catalyst for this Acceptor-less Dehydrogenative Polymerization and also depolymerization too, attaining high conversion and turnover number with the low catalyst loading and addition of suitable base.The synthesized thermoplastic polymers demonstrated thermal properties comparable to commercial polyethylenes, with decomposition temperature of 395 °C and melting point(Tm). Increasing the content of branched co-monomers reduced crystallinity and modulus, ultimately leading to elastomeric behavior, while all compositions maintained high tensile strength(σUTS=16–27 MPa) and toughness(UT=100-180 MJ m−3), outstripping that of commercial plastics. Additionally, these PE-like materials showed excellent environmental stability and incorporating thioether or sulfone groups in the copolymers exhibited excellent adhesion to various surfaces-including stainless steel, aluminum and so on.To overcome the traditional plastic recycling challenges, the authors introduced efficient chemical depolymerization of synthesized bio-based-PE-like polymers driven by hydrogen gas in the presence of mixed commercial plastics using the Mn-based catalyst[Mn], achieving high monomer recovery(91-99%), leaving other plastics impurities unaltered. The recovered monomers were successfully repolymerized through multiple cycles without loss of efficiency and stability, confirming the robustness of the closed-loop process. Furthermore, high-yield monomer recovery was achieved even in the presence of post-consumer plastics and at larger scales, highlighting the system’s practical and scalable recycling potential and route to sustainability.",

      "summary": "We all know that the human brain is filled with neurons that direct our dreams and administer our body's organ functions effectively. But that's not all. Recent studies have found that a specific type of neuron in the eye plays a crucial role in vision—almost as if it has its own \"eye and brain.\" Fascinating, right? For years, scientists have known that a network of blood vessels nourishes the retina (the posterior part of the eye), where light refracted from the lens forms an image. However, how this intricate structure develops remained a mystery. Now, researchers at UC San Francisco have discovered that a specific subset of retinal neurons, called perivascular neurons, directs the formation of the retina’s three-dimensional vascular lattice.These researchers worked with newborn mice, whose eyes require several weeks to fully develop. Then they labeled the retinal neurons closest to blood vessels with a protein that glows bright green under ultraviolet light, allowing them to observe the lattice as it formed. These neurons establish direct contact with developing blood vessels through perisomatic endfeet(specialized neuronal structures that extend from the cell bodies of certain neurons) physically connect with surrounding blood vessels. This interaction guides the precise 3D lattice formation, which is essential for retinal health.Perivascular neurons produce a mechanosensitive ion channel protein called PIEZO2, which enables them to sense contact with other cells. Now the absence of PIEZO2 disrupts these neurovascular interactions, leading to disorganized vascular structures, reduced capillary perfusion, and increased susceptibility to something called ischemic damage (tissue damage caused by lack of blood flow, eventually leading to cell death). In mice that could not produce PIEZO2, perivascular neurons failed to maintain contact with blood vessels, causing the vascular network to grow in a tangled, disorganized manner that disrupted blood flow. As a result, the surrounding nerve cells became oxygen-starved, deteriorated, and made the mice more vulnerable to stroke-like injuries.By collaborating with developmental biologists, researchers could confirm that perivascular neurons also exist in the human retina, suggesting their importance in human vascular health. This discovery paves the way for new therapeutic approaches aimed at repairing or reorganizing damaged blood vessel networks, offering potential treatments for glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and stroke. By exploring how neurons regulate vascular development, scientists can develop targeted therapies to maintain healthy blood flow, prevent neurodegeneration, and restore vision.",

      "summary": "The study by Eshika Halder and Dr. S. Annagiri from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata explores intraspecific competition in Diacamma indicum during colony relocation, a cooperative yet challenging process triggered by environmental stressors like habitat destruction, resource depletion, or predation. Unlike the commonly studied contexts of foraging and mating, this work focuses on competition for limited nesting sites, providing new insights into ant behavioral ecology and colony fitness.The authors investigate how colony size affects competitive success, the nature of aggression during relocation, and how these interactions impact colony fitness. The experiments used both comparable-sized (CS) and non-comparable-sized (NCS) colonies in a controlled lab setup, simulating natural relocation conditions with two old nests and a single new nest. Behavioral data such as aggression, brood theft, and recruitment via tandem running were observed and statistically analyzed. Control groups (colonies relocating without competition and non- relocating colonies) helped assess the baseline levels of mortality and relocation efficiency.Results show that colony size significantly influences success. In CS trials, one colony successfully relocated in 13 of 17 cases. In NCS trials, larger colonies dominated in 11 of 14 instances due to their numerical advantage in both aggression and recruitment. Smaller colonies struggled to manage both tasks simultaneously. Interestingly, colony mergers occurred in about 25% of trials, facilitated by cross-colony tandem running. These often led to the death of one gamergate, typically from the smaller colony.Aggression was concentrated around critical zones like old and new nests, especially during the recruitment phase. Winning colonies were more strategic, involving fewer individuals in aggressive acts and reserving more for relocation. Brood theft was a notable behavior, primarily by larger colonies in NCS setups, enabling workforce expansion without reproductive cost.The study highlights the high fitness costs of competition during relocation. Losing colonies exhibited mortality rates three to five times higher than controls, while even winners experienced elevated losses. These findings underscore the ecological risks associated with relocation, particularly when multiple colonies compete for limited resources. Overall, this research offers valuable insights into how social insects respond to ecological stress and competition. It contributes to our understanding of behavioral strategies, colony dynamics and has implications for conservation, especially under increasing environmental pressures.",

      "summary": "Through high-resolution imaging and transcriptomic analysis, the researchers reveal that C. perkinsii undergoes a structured, palintomic (cleavage-like) cell division cycle, forming multicellular colonies with distinct cell types. This process mirrors aspects of early animal development, including spatial cell differentiation and gene regulation patterns similar to those in embryonic stages of sponges, cnidarians, and ctenophores. However, unlike true animals, C. perkinsii does not exhibit coordinated function among its differentiated cells, making it a potential intermediary form in evolutionary history.Comparative transcriptomic analysis suggests that some of the genetic regulatory mechanisms underlying C. perkinsii's development align with those found in early-diverging metazoans, implying that the genetic toolkit for multicellularity predates the emergence of animals. These findings challenge the assumption that coordinated, spatial differentiation only evolved with true animal multicellularity. Instead, they support the idea that early unicellular relatives of animals may have already experimented with complex developmental strategies, long before animals emerged.This study provides an evolutionary snapshot of the transition from unicellular to multicellular life, demonstrating that fundamental aspects of cell differentiation and developmental regulation were present in the common ancestors of animals and their unicellular relatives. Understanding how and why these mechanisms evolved could offer new insights into the origins of animal life itself.",

      "summary": "Copper plays an intriguing dual role in biology despite being a trace element - a nutrient and a toxin. Copper Metabolism Group from IISER Kolkata explores this duality using the protozoan parasite Leishmania major and how it hijacks host copper pathways to evade immune defenses. The work provides interesting perspectives on potential therapeutic interventions for the tropical disease of Leishmaniasis. Copper toxicity is a powerful weapon that host macrophages use to counteract invading pathogens. They accumulate copper in the phagolysosomal compartments leading to the macrophages generating Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) that can damage or kill intracellular parasites. However, L. major has managed to evade this threat using interesting tactics revealing that the parasite manipulates two key copper-regulating proteins in host macrophages: ATP7A, which transports copper to pathogen-containing compartments, and CTR1, the primary copper importer. The parasite then induces ATP7A degradation through proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. Simultaneously, CTR1 is downregulated at the transcriptional level and endocytosed, leading to limited copper supply to the macrophage. These multiple strategies ensure its survival within the host. The researchers observed a remarkable systemic redistribution of copper during the infection, suggesting a reverse strategy by the host to protect itself. The heart, which forms a major copper reservoir, shows downregulation of CTR1, leading to the release of stored copper into systemic circulation. This copper is directed to the infection site, enabling the host to combat the pathogen. It has been observed in mice models that copper supplementation slows down lesion development and reduces parasite load, whereas copper chelation triggers the infection further, highlighting the role of copper as not only a metabolic cofactor but also an active participant in immune defense. So far, new avenues for the treatment of Leishmaniasis have opened up that could target the copper pathways. Modulating copper levels can be done in several ways like by supplementation or selective chelation, and could complement current treatment methods. The idea of combining systemic copper mobilization or developing drugs that mimic this redistribution is another avenue. Such approaches could also help battle the existing problems with drug resistance and toxicity. While answering some interesting questions, the work also opens up a plethora of new ones. What are the molecular signals governing systemic copper redistribution during infection, and how does it revert post-infection? How do these mechanisms compare and contrast across other host-pathogen systems?",

      "summary": "A new approach towards anti-cancer therapy has emerged. Kwang-Hyun Cho and group from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology has found cancer reversion to be effective in treating colorectal cancer. The team has found a trio of master regulators which can transform back colorectal cancer cells into typical healthy enterocytes. Inhibition of the maestro regulators trio consisting MYB, HDAC2, and FOXA2 has been found to collectively induce differentiation while suppressing malignancy. Current research on reversing cancer cells lacks the expertise to understand the mechanism of cellular differentiation and has a restricted systemic approach to discover the key regulators. A computational scheme for single-cell Boolean network inference and control entitled BENEIN was established by Cho and colleagues. It can restore Boolean models of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and pinpoint a group of master regulators in charge of desired cellular differentiation. The possibility of blocking the master regulators in cancer cells' reversion was validated by in silico study. Based on the in-silico analysis, three different cancer cell lines namely HT-29, HCT-116, and CACO-2 were evaluated in-vitro and in-vivo for cancer reversion upon inhibition of the master regulators. In-vitro analysis showcased decrease in proliferation rate for simultaneous inhibition as compared to the single gene knockouts.

      "title": "The First Ancestor: How LUCA Shaped Life on Earth",
      "author": "Swarnendu Saha",

      "summary": "Imagine when Earth was just a young, boiling mass of rock and water, with no plants, animals, or even bacteria as we know them today. Now, picture a tiny, ancient life form—the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA)—swimming in that primordial world, setting the stage for all life on our planet. This new research takes us back 4.2 billion years to uncover LUCA’s nature, its environment, and how it kick-started life's evolution.The study uses cutting-edge molecular clock techniques and phylogenetics (a genetic family tree) to pinpoint LUCA’s age to about 4.2 billion years ago—right after Earth became stable enough to support life. LUCA wasn’t just a simple blob of organic material. It had a complex genome, roughly 2.5 megabases, coding for around 2,600 proteins—comparable to modern prokaryotes. This means LUCA had a working metabolism, an early immune system, and interactions with other microbes in its environment.One of the most exciting aspects of this study is how it places LUCA within a broader ecological system. Rather than existing in isolation, LUCA likely lived in a bustling microbial community, shaping the chemistry of early Earth. It thrived as an anaerobic acetogen, producing energy by converting carbon dioxide and hydrogen into acetate, much like some modern bacteria. This metabolic process was crucial because it created a niche for other microbes, including early methanogens, which produced methane, feeding into Earth’s early atmospheric and climate systems.The study also challenges the long-held idea that LUCA lived exclusively in extreme environments like hydrothermal vents. While that remains a possibility, researchers suggest that LUCA might have also existed near the ocean’s surface, benefiting from atmospheric hydrogen. This new perspective opens doors to reconsidering how and where life first took hold on our planet.LUCA represents our shared ancestry with every living thing on Earth—from bacteria to blue whales, fungi to humans. Understanding LUCA helps scientists piece together the grand puzzle of evolution, shedding light on how life emerged and adapted to a changing planet. This paper goes beyond history—it reveals the intricate connections between life and planetary systems. LUCA’s legacy is still alive in every cell today, making this research essential for anyone curious about the origins of life.",

      "author": "Bijay Kumar Sahoo",

      "summary": "Persistent currents (PCs) can be induced in rings with circumferences smaller than the electron's phase-coherence length by threading magnetic flux through the center of the ring. PCs in mesoscopic rings have been the subject of intense investigation since their proposal by Buttiker, Landauer, and Imry in 1983. In this work, we investigate PC's behavior in spin-orbit coupled rings under the influence of a Zeeman field (without a need for a flux threading the ring), which contrasts with traditional PC observed in rings threaded by magnetic flux. We find that non-zero values of the Zeeman field and spin-orbit coupling are necessary for the emergence of PC in our setup.Mainly, in ballistic rings, we observe that PC varies inversely with system size, along with PC being zero at half-filling for an even number of sites. At half-filling PC becomes zero, because the current carried by mth electron from the bottom of the bands is the same as the current carried by mth electron from the top of the band, which makes the currents at filling Ne (number of electrons) and 2N-Ne (N being the number of sites in the ring) equal in magnitude and opposite in sign. Moreover, introducing on-site disorder to our setup results in a suppression of PC, with exponential decay observed for large disorder strengths and quadratic decay for smaller disorder strengths. Notably, we find that at half-filling disorder can enhance the PC in individual samples, though the configuration-averaged PC is zero.Furthermore, we find that the standard deviation of PC increases with disorder strength, reaching a maximum before decreasing to zero at high disorder strengths. We also find that with disorder the PC varies exponentially with system size. We also investigate persistent spin current, which behaves similar to PC except that it is not zero at half-filling. Our findings shed light on the intricate interplay between spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman fields, and disorder in mesoscopic quantum systems, offering new avenues for theoretical exploration and experimental verification.",

      "summary": "Our planet Earth also has a global electric field – as fundamental as its gravity and magnetic fields. Researchers have successfully measured this electric field for the first time. The quest started over half a century ago when a steady stream of outgoing plasma particles was detected near the Earth's poles. Theories have been proposed and refined over time to understand this peculiar phenomenon. Peculiar. Because the temperature of the outflowing plasma is too cold to evaporate due to solar radiation. Therefore, existing knowledge of global energy fields failed to explain it. Alternatively, the existence of an independent, electric field was hypothesized. However, more mature technology was required to make precise measurements and test the hypothesis. The research team flew a suborbital rocket through the arctic skies that touched the exosphere while sampling various ionospheric properties. The photoelectron spectrometer onboard detected a minute change in electric potential of 0.55 volts – less than that of a standard AA battery – across an altitude range of ~500 km, confirming the existence of such a global electric field. Due to an asymmetric gravitational pull on the lighter electrons and heavier ion cores, charge separation occurs in the atmosphere. The Coulombic force partially counteracts this charge separation; the associated electric field is ambipolar, as it works in both directions. The net effect of this global ambipolar field is to puff up the atmosphere, lifting some ions high enough to escape through the polar caps and giving rise to polar winds.",

      "author": "M. Sahnawaz Alam",
      "affiliation": "RWTH Aachen University, Germany",
      "summary": "Color centers in diamond, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center—which consists of a nitrogen atom adjacent to a vacancy in the carbon lattice—are renowned for their exceptional quantum properties, making them ideal candidates for applications in nanoscale sensing and quantum information processing at room temperature. However, NV centers often suffer from low contrast in experiments, which hampers their performance and limits practical applications. Integrating NV centers with laser-written optical waveguides enhances the coupling of light to these quantum systems, facilitating more efficient manipulation and readout of their states. This integration addresses the low-contrast issue by improving the interaction between NV centers and light. However, the process of laser writing photonic structures inherently introduces strain into the diamond lattice. This strain can alter the electronic and spin properties of the NV centers, affecting their performance and the fidelity of quantum operations. Until now, the full impact of this strain on defect centers has not been  thoroughly understood. In our combined experimental and theoretical study, we demonstrate that optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy—a technique commonly used to probe the spin states of NV centers—provides sufficient information to fully characterize the spatial distribution of strain within laser-written diamond waveguides. Remarkably, this characterization is possible even without the application of an external constant magnetic field. Our findings present an accessible and non-invasive tool for mapping strain in diamond-based photonic devices. By utilizing ODMR spectroscopy, researchers can gain detailed insights into strain distributions, enabling the optimization of device fabrication processes and the improvement of quantum device performance. This advancement is a  significant step forward in the development of diamond- based quantum technologies, potentially impacting a wide  range of applications from high-precision sensing to quantum communication and computation.",

      "summary": "This paper, “GWTC-3: Compact Binary Coalescences Observed by LIGO and Virgo during the Second Part of the Third Observing Run”, is an excerpt from the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog. The report was published in December 2023 in the journal Physical Review X that reports on observation of gravitational waves by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA for the second half of the period of the third observing run. The interval covered is from November 1, 2019, through March 27, 2020. Our very own Professor Rajesh Kumble Nayak has been a part of this team from IISER Kolkata. <br> <br>The paper also lists 35 new gravitational-wave events detected during that period, all the result of a \"compact binary coalescence\" in which pairs of black holes or neutron stars orbit ever tighter until they eventually merge. This brings the number of gravitational-wave detections across three observation runs to 90. Most of the events in the catalog arise from the merger of black holes, which can be  pretty large, but this observing run also marks the first definite identification of neutron star–black hole (NSBH) mergers. Curiously, however, no BNS mergers were confirmed during this period. <br> <br>The researchers selected these signals with advanced algorithms and data calibration, estimating probabilities for each event to be of astrophysical rather than noise artifacts. As there is always some inevitable noise, the  probability for these signals to be due to a non- astrophysical origin is estimated to be around 10-15%. All  the data are made available in the public domain for use by the community through the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center. The expanding dataset from GWTC-3 gives unparalleled insight into the properties and behaviors of black holes and neutron stars, offering unique insights into the population in the universe and providing informative input into the theory governing their formation, structure, and evolution.",

      "title": "Strange Metal and Quantum Spin Liquid in Heavy-Fermion Material: An Array of Exotic Phases",
      "author": "Abhirup Mukherjee",
      "affiliation": "IISER Kolkata",
      "summary": "Strange metals and spin liquids constitute deviations from the \"standard model\" of condensed matter physics. For most of the twentieth century, metals were believed to be  smoothly connected to non-interacting electrons at low- energies (the so-called Landau's Fermi liquid theory), and  insulators and superconductors were believed to arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking (the ground state does not have all symmetries of the Hamiltonian). Violations of these ideas were observed in the 1980s, a notable example being the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in copper oxide materials. The strange metal phase of the  copper oxides, while being a metal, displayed a linear-in- temperature resistivity, in contrast to the quadratic-in- temperature resistivty of Landau Fermi liquids. Due to the  large transition temperature of the material and the proximity to an electronic-correlation driven Mott insulator, Phillip Anderson hyppthesised that the ground state of the Mott insulator was close to a \"spin liquid\", where the system does not settle into any particular configuration (in contrast to the symmetry-broken insulators) but keeps shifting (in the sense of a quantum superposition) between various configurations. <br> <br> While these exotic phases typically emerge in different materials, the authors of the present work have experimentally realised these exotic phases in crystals of  the material Ba4 Nb1-xRu3+xO12, where x is the hole- doping concentration. By tuning the doping concentration,  the material undergoes transition from a heavy strange metal phase to a heavy Fermi liquid phase to finally a spin liquid phase. The \"heaviness\" arises from the fact that these are heavy-fermion materials in which the inter-electron interactions increase the \"inertia\" of the quasiparticles. Other results suggest that the excitations in all three phases are described by spinons - spin-1/2 charge-neutral objects. These spinons are fractionalised excitations (to see why, recall that flipping a spin from -1/2 to 1/2 creates a spin-1 excitation). At the heart of these exotic phenomenon in this material is the underlying triangular lattice that leads to geometric frustration (it is not simple to obtain an energy-minimising configuration of spins on this lattice) and the emergence of novel elementary excitations (the spinons). Such a material provides a wonderful platform to realise and study these highly-correlated phases of matter.",
